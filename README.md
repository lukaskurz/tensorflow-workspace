# tensorflow-workspace

My personal workspace setup for tensorflow with GPU support

# Get started

## Prerequisites

* [Install docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
* [Install Nvidia docker runtime](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker)

You can install these prerequesites using the guides in the mentioned sites or using my own install script.

```bash install.sh```

I would recommend to use the sites, because they are always up-to-date and are faster in fixing bugs and issues with their scripts.
